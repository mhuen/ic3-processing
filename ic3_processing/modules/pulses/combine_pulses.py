    This can be used to minimize disk usage and also reduce the required
    time of likelihood-based reconstruction methods that iterate over
    individual pulses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frame : I3Frame
        The current I3Frame with the pulse series to combine.
    pulse_key : str
        The pulse series for which to combine pulses.
    output_name : str
        The desired output name to which the new pulse series
        with the combined pulses will be written to.
    time_diff : float, optional
        The maximum time difference for which two pulses are combined.
        Pulses with a time difference below this value are combined to a
        single pulse. This pulse will have the total charge of both
        pulses and the time of the first pulse.
